# Scikit-Learn Practice Solutions

This repository contains potential solutions to the Scikit-Learn exercises. The exercises are based on and directly taken from the **Quick Introduction to Scikit-Learn** notebook, and cover fundamental machine learning concepts.

## Overview
This notebook offers solutions to various tasks using **Scikit-Learn**, a popular machine learning library in Python. The tasks focus on applying classification, regression, and other machine learning techniques to real-world datasets.

The solutions are designed to help users learn and practice the steps involved in building machine learning models, including:
- **Preprocessing data**
- **Training models**
- **Evaluating model performance**
- **Hyperparameter tuning**

## Technologies Used
The project uses the following libraries:
- **Scikit-Learn**: The core library for machine learning tasks such as classification and regression.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization to help understand model performance and datasets.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for numerical computing, essential for handling data arrays.
- **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library used to load and preprocess datasets.

## Getting Started
To run the notebook and try out the solutions yourself, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/scikit-learn-practice-solutions.git
   ```
   
2. **Install Required Libraries**
   If you don't have the required libraries installed, use the following command to install them:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn matplotlib numpy pandas
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**
   Open the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment or VS Code, and follow the instructions in the comments.
