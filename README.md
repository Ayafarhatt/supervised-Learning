## Overview
This notebook provides solutions to a variety of tasks using **Scikit-Learn**, one of the most widely-used machine learning libraries in Python. The tasks focus on applying classification, regression, and other machine learning techniques to real-world datasets.

The solutions are designed to help users learn and practice the key steps involved in building machine learning models, including:
- **Data preprocessing**
- **Model training**
- **Model evaluation**
- **Hyperparameter tuning**

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following libraries:
- **Scikit-Learn**: The core library for machine learning tasks such as classification and regression.
- **Matplotlib**: A visualization library used to display model performance and dataset insights.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for numerical computing, essential for data manipulation and handling arrays.
- **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library used for loading, cleaning, and preprocessing datasets.
